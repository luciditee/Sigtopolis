Sigtopolis
==========

An open-source city simulator, powered by slick2d and isomatrix.

Sigtopolis is an open-source city simulation game, using the
slick2d/lwjgl libraries for rendering, sound, and
pathfinding, as well as the custom-made Isomatrix game engine.

Isomatrix uses Java and is therefore cross-platform on any 32 or
64 bit system supporting LWJGL.

Support can be found at http://sigmatauproductions.com/sigtopolis
as well as on irc.bladerock.net, in channel #sigtau-dev.
