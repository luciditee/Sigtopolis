The .class files are included in this package for SlopeType and Direction
because they correspond to .java files containing only enums.  For whatever
reason, Java is not compiling these files by default, and you may run into
issues at runtime (such as a NoClassDefFoundError) if you try to run the project
without these files.  Thus, the .class files are included and pre-compiled for
your convenience.

Note that you will need to recompile these files individually if you make any
changes to the structure or functionality of SlopeType.java or Direction.java.
