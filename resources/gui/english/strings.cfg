# Unless you have a special font requirement, the font should almost always
# be set to 'standard' (without the quotes).  Exceptions include dingbats,
# Asian characters, special punctuation, and other characters not found in
# the standard font supplied with Sigtopolis (Roboto).  If your font contains
# anything from the Latin default/expanded charsets, Greek, or Cyrillic 
# characters, or anything in the normal UTF-8 lineup, you should have no issue.

# This is the translation of the name of the language, i.e. for the Spanish
# language, you'd use Espa√±ol, and so on.  The directory names for the languages
# are stored in English because some filesystems don't like foreign characters in
# directory names, but we can use Unicode here because it's not a directory.
